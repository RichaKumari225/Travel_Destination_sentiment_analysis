### 🔥 **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Used **Scrapy** and **Selenium** to scrape customer reviews, ratings, and metadata from platforms like Expedia, Booking.com, and Tours4Fun.  
   - Implemented **proxy rotation** and user-agent randomization to bypass bot detection.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Removed null and duplicate values.  
   - Converted dates to the correct format.  
   - Standardized sentiment labels (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`).  
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values.  

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - **VADER & TextBlob** → Assigned sentiment scores to each review.  
   - Categorized reviews into `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.  
   - Calculated overall platform sentiment scores.  

4. **Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI):**
   - Created an **interactive Power BI dashboard** displaying:  
     - **Site-specific metrics**: Total reviews, average rating, and sentiment distribution.  
     - **Trends over time**: Review volume across different platforms.  
     - **Sentiment breakdown**: Pie and bar charts showing sentiment proportions.  
     - **Helpfulness score**: Average helpfulness by platform.  
     - **Dynamic filters and slicers** for single-site analysis.
